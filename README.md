Hello, I'm Todor Arnaudov, aka Tosh, <a href="http://artificial-mind.blogspot.bg/2008/04/twenkid.html">Twenkid</a> etc. About:
- I am the author of the <a href="http://artificial-mind.blogspot.com/2010/04/universal-artificial-intelligence.html">world's first University course in Artificial General Intelligence</a>, presented at the University in Plovdiv, Bulgaria in 2010 and 2011 and of the <a href="https://github.com/Twenkid/Theory-of-Universe-and-Mind">"Theory of Universe and Mind"</a>, works first published 2001-2004 when I was a teenager, which precedes with many years and even decades many similar and analogical interdisciplinary theories of top researchers which are recently getting more popular (Friston et al., Levin et al., Bach; Azarian; also related Jeff Hawkins and Wolfram's work etc.)
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking for research partners, collaborators, collaborating companies, supporters, projects etc. and looking for cofounders of the extended non-individual version of my interdisciplinary research institute in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Philosophy of AI, Digital Universe, Transhumanism etc., called "Sacred Computer", which I run on my own self-funded and it happens to be one of the oldest such initiatives from the new wave around the year 2000. Check the AGI infrastructure project as a search of collaborators on practical preperational project: [https://github.com/Twenkid/Bulgarian-Internet-Archive-And-Search-Engine](https://github.com/Twenkid/Vsy-Jack-Of-All-Trades-AGI-Bulgarian-Internet-Archive-And-Search-Engin)
- üå± I'm a <b>"Universal man"</b> who enjoys, or "suffers", an enormous set of diverse talents, curiosity, multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity.
- üå± As a teenager I was a "child prodigy" and visionary in Artificial General Intelligence, Digital Phsysics, Philosophy of Mind and Philosophy of AI, Transhumanism, Cognition analysis, Linguistics etc. and an AGI pioneer in the times when terms like "AGI", "transhumanism" didn't exist or were unknown or SF. You probably haven't heard of me and of my early 2000s teenage visionary works, with their summary title <a href="https://github.com/Twenkid/Theory-of-Universe-and-Mind">"Theory of Universe and Mind"</a>, which defined directions, ideas and principles, "goals", which were independently shared after that or about the same time by other AGI pioneers and mainstream researchers (e.g. Jeff Hawkins, Karl Friston etc.; Schmidhuber, Hutter etc.). Mine were published since 2001 in the Bulgarian AGI e-zine "Sacred Computer" (–°–≤–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏—è—Ç —Å–º–µ—Ç–∞—á) etc.; my 2003 <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=https://artificial-mind.blogspot.com/2020/07/interdisciplinary-research-institute.html">strategy/proposal for creation of a super interdisciplinary AGI institute</a> in Bulgaria for one million euro (compare to DeepMind (2010), Stanford's Human Centered AI (2018), MIT's One Billion Institute (2018), ETH in Switzerland (2020) and INSAIT in Sofia (2022). Compare also my original interdisciplinary <a href="http://artificial-mind.blogspot.com/2010/04/universal-artificial-intelligence.html">AGI University courses</a> in 2010 and 2011 with MIT's first course in 2018.
- üí¨ A documentary book, a collection of my visionary and pioneering writings, whole or excerpts etc., compared in chronology with the academic and the mainstream AGI publications which seem to be matching my theory and ideas and confirming the directions up to nowadays (2023). This book had its first compiled complete draft in 2020, 800-something pages, but it's been updated and is yet to be published (currently approaching 1300 pages and may reach 1400 or even 1500+, depending on what would be included...) An old announcement: initially <a href="https://artificial-mind.blogspot.com/2022/01/transhumanism-spirdonov-20-years-after-Sacred-Computer-Smetach.html">in Bulgarian</a> (<i>"History, Theory and Pioneers of Artificial General Intelligence and Transhumanism"</i>, more than 1000 pages long in its layout back then in Jan 2022.)
