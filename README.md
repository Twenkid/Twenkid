Hello, I'm Todor Arnaudov, aka Tosh, <a href="http://artificial-mind.blogspot.bg/2008/04/twenkid.html">Twenkid</a> etc. About:
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking for research partners, collaborators, collaborating companies, supporters, projects etc. and looking for cofounders of the extended non-individual version of my interdisciplinary research institute in AGI "Sacred Computer", which I run on my own self-funded. Check the AGI infrastructure project for searching of collaborators on practical preperational project: https://github.com/Twenkid/Bulgarian-Internet-Archive-And-Search-Engine
- üå± A <b>"universal man"</b> who enjoys, or "suffers", diverse talents, curiosity, multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity.
- üå± A "child prodigy" in Artificial General Intelligence and Transhumanism and an AGI pioneer in times when these terms didn't exist or were unknown. You probably haven't heard of me and of my early 2000s teenage visionary works, with their summary title <a href="https://research.twenkid.com/agi/2010/en/">"Theory of Universe and Mind"</a>, which defined directions, ideas and principles, "goals", which were independently shared after that or about the same time by other AGI pioneers and mainstream researchers (e.g. Jeff Hawkins, Karl Friston etc.; Schmidhuber, Hutter etc.). Mine were published since 2001 in the Bulgarian AGI e-zine "Sacred Computer" (–°–≤–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏—è—Ç —Å–º–µ—Ç–∞—á) etc.; my 2003 <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=https://artificial-mind.blogspot.com/2020/07/interdisciplinary-research-institute.html">strategy/proposal for creation of a super interdisciplinary AGI institute</a> in Bulgaria for one million euro (compare to DeepMind (2010), Stanford's Human Centered AI (2018), MIT's One Billion Institute (2018), ETH in Switzerland (2020) and INSAIT in Sofia (2022). Compare also my original interdisciplinary <a href="http://artificial-mind.blogspot.com/2010/04/universal-artificial-intelligence.html">AGI University courses</a> in 2010 and 2011 with MIT's first course in 2018.
- üí¨ A documentary book, a collection of my visionary and pioneering writings, whole or excerpts etc., compared in chronology with the academic and the mainstream AGI publications. This work was compiled mainly in 2020, updated later, but it is yet to be published, initially <a href="https://artificial-mind.blogspot.com/2022/01/transhumanism-spirdonov-20-years-after-Sacred-Computer-Smetach.html">in Bulgarian</a> (<i>"History, Theory and Pioneers of Artificial General Intelligence and Transhumanism"</i>, more than 1000 pages long in its current layout.)

- ‚ö° Youtube: <b>"Twenkid Studio - Artificial Mind"</b>. Watch my funny & serious "medley" channel and the latest deepfake comedy series made with my grayscale version of DeepFaceLab <a href="https://github.com/Twenkid/DeepFaceLab-SAEHDBW">"ArnoldDFR"</a> or DFL-SAEHDBW: <b>"Arnold Schwarzenegger: The Governor of Bulgaria"</b> https://youtu.be/n2JMGqxOYfA ; Part 2: https://youtu.be/k1MZ8eIUjXE etc. There are some programming/research videos and lectures, (GPT2-Medium training from scratch, Twitchslam API update, World's first university course in AGI, one of the lectures from the course (in Bulgarian) etc., some of them are in Bulgarian)
