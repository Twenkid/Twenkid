Hello, I'm Todor Arnaudov, aka Tosh, <a href="http://artificial-mind.blogspot.bg/2008/04/twenkid.html">Twenkid</a> etc.
- üå± I'm a <b>"universal man"</b> and I enjoy diverse talents, curiosity, multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity.
- üå± I was a "child prodigy" in Artificial General Intelligence and Transhumanism and an AGI pioneer in times when these terms didn't exist or were unknown; sure, you probably haven't heard of that and my early 2000s works (published since 2001 in the Bulgarian AGI e-zine "Sacred Computer" (–°–≤–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏—è—Ç —Å–º–µ—Ç–∞—á) etc.; my 2003 <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=https://artificial-mind.blogspot.com/2020/07/interdisciplinary-research-institute.html">strategy/proposal for creation of a super interdisciplinary AGI institute</a> in Bulgaria for one million euro (compare to DeepMind (2010), Stanford's Human Centered AI (2018), MIT's One Billion Institute (2018), ETH in Switzerland (2020) and INSAIT in Sofia (2022). Compare also my original interdisciplinary <a href="http://artificial-mind.blogspot.com/2010/04/universal-artificial-intelligence.html">AGI University courses</a> in 2010 and 2011 with MIT's first course in 2018.
- üí¨ A documentary book, a collection of my visionary and pioneering writings etc., compared in chronology with the academic and the mainstream AGI publications. This work was compiled mainly in 2020, updated later, but it is yet to be published, initially <a href="https://artificial-mind.blogspot.com/2022/01/transhumanism-spirdonov-20-years-after-Sacred-Computer-Smetach.html">in Bulgarian</a> (<i>"History, Theory and Pioneers in Artificial General Intelligence and Transhumanism"</i>, more than 1000 pages long in its current layout.)
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking for research partners, collaborators, supporters, projects. I am also looking for readers and viewers, and sponsors/donations and/or customers for my works (research, programming, literature, creative and media etc.), and for adding more energy and possibly finding partners and collaborators to my interdisciplinary research institute in AGI, which so far I run on my own self-funded.
