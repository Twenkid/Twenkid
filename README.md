- <b>Join the rolling AGI conference SIGI-2025/Sacred-Computer-2025:</b> https://github.com/Twenkid/SIGI-2025/
- Hello, I'm Todor Arnaudov, aka Tosh, <a href="http://artificial-mind.blogspot.bg/2008/04/twenkid.html">Twenkid</a> etc. About:
- I am the author of the original and interdisciplinary <a href="http://artificial-mind.blogspot.com/2010/04/universal-artificial-intelligence.html">world's first University course in Artificial General Intelligence</a> (AGI), presented at the University of Plovdiv, Bulgaria in 2010 and 2011 and of the <a href="https://github.com/Twenkid/Theory-of-Universe-and-Mind">"Theory of Universe and Mind"</a> (TOUM) - a set of advanced interdisciplinary works with the practical direction: AGI, first published 2001-2004 when I was a teenager, which I taught as one of the ultimate lectures of the AGI courses. These works happened to be predecessors of analogical, the same and similar theories and reasoning of the current top scientists which are getting popular in the 2020s, such as Free Energy Principle/Active Inference, Scale Free Cognition, Diverse Intelligence and many others and some of the core principles and predictions of the TOUM, such as the ubiquitousness of the hierarchical multiscale prediction for all sensory-motor modalities are practically applied in technologies such as the Transformers (although in their basic form they are not yet interactive enough, do not implement actual causality-control units/complete self-sufficient local universal simulators of virtual universes; however they successfully reproduce the by-effects of such potential generative models, encoded in the strcuture of the data on which they were trained, and also they demonstrate the predictions about art as "imitation of algorithms" and generation of "plausible" predictions/output/continuations. See the linked works from the repository of the TOUM and look forward for <b>Universe and Mind 6</b> and a lot of unpublished stuff, I already started to publish appencdices.
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking for research partners, collaborators, collaborating companies, supporters, projects etc. and cofounders of the extended non-individual version of my interdisciplinary research institute in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Philosophy of AI, Digital Universe, Transhumanism etc., called "The Sacred Computer" ("–°–≤–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏—è—Ç –°–º–µ—Ç–∞—á"), which I run on my own self-funded and it happens to be one of the oldest such initiatives from the new wave around the year 2000. Check the AGI infrastructure project as a search of collaborators on practical preperational project: [https://github.com/Twenkid/Bulgarian-Internet-Archive-And-Search-Engine](https://github.com/Twenkid/Vsy-Jack-Of-All-Trades-AGI-Bulgarian-Internet-Archive-And-Search-Engine)
- Join SIGI-2024: Self-Improving General Intelligence, a whole-year conference/forum: https://github.com/Twenkid/SIGI-2024  News about it: there will be an "official" section for Deepfake Cinema, Satire, Computational Creativity.
- üå± I'm a <b>"Universal man"</b> who enjoys, or "suffers", an enormous set of diverse talents, curiosity, multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity - that allowed me to create the TOUM.
- üå± As a teenager I was a "child prodigy" and visionary in Artificial General Intelligence, Digital Phsysics, Philosophy of Mind and Philosophy of AI, Transhumanism, Cognition analysis, Linguistics and Writing - of course Programming and Computers - etc. and an AGI pioneer in the times when terms like "AGI", "transhumanism" didn't exist or were unknown or SF. You probably haven't heard of me and of my early 2000s teenage visionary works, with their summary title <a href="https://github.com/Twenkid/Theory-of-Universe-and-Mind">"Theory of Universe and Mind"</a>, which defined directions, ideas and principles, "goals", which were independently shared after that or about the same time by other AGI pioneers and mainstream researchers (e.g. Jeff Hawkins, Karl Friston etc.; Schmidhuber, Hutter etc.). Mine were published since 2001 in the Bulgarian AGI e-zine "Sacred Computer" (–°–≤–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏—è—Ç —Å–º–µ—Ç–∞—á) etc.; my 2003 <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=https://artificial-mind.blogspot.com/2020/07/interdisciplinary-research-institute.html">strategy/proposal for creation of a super interdisciplinary AGI institute</a> in Bulgaria for one million euro (compare to DeepMind (2010), Stanford's Human Centered AI (2018), MIT's One Billion Institute (2018), ETH in Switzerland (2020) and INSAIT in Sofia (2022). Compare also my original interdisciplinary <a href="http://artificial-mind.blogspot.com/2010/04/universal-artificial-intelligence.html">AGI University courses</a> in 2010 and 2011 with MIT's first course in 2018.
- üí¨ A documentary book, a collection of my visionary and pioneering writings, whole or excerpts etc., compared in chronology with the academic and the mainstream AGI publications which seem to be matching my theory and ideas and confirming the directions up to nowadays (2023). This book had its first compiled complete draft in 2020, 800-something pages, but it's been updated and is yet to be published (currently approaching 1600 pages, it's possible to exceed 1700 or 1800 with the inclusion of the new work <b>"Universe and Mind 6"</b> and "gospels" of more modern AI researchers and "prophets" (interviews and summaries with comments of mine)) .An old announcement: initially <a href="https://artificial-mind.blogspot.com/2022/01/transhumanism-spirdonov-20-years-after-Sacred-Computer-Smetach.html">in Bulgarian</a> (<i>"History, Theory and Pioneers of Artificial General Intelligence and Transhumanism"</i>, more than 1000 pages long in its layout back then in Jan 2022.)
